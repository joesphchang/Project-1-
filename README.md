## Project Description

The game space-man is usually played in a group or with another person. The person chosen to has to think of a word in a certain category for the challengers. This is a game of right or wrong. You only have 6 tries to guess the word before the space-ship is built and flies away. You have the whole alphabet to guess through and once you guess that letter it is canceled out for the duration of the round. You're also on a timer every round of letter guessing to sweat your armpits trying to guess the letters of the word. If you get the word right, you are rewarded with street credits and a pat on the back. The challenger in this game has the choice of continuing or stopping the game right there. There's only so many rounds of words, but once you get to the end you will feel like a space-man/woman.
