## Project Description

The game space-man is usually played in a group or with another person. The person chosen to has to think of a word in a certain category for the challengers. This is a game of right or wrong. You only have 6 tries to guess the word before the space-ship is built and flies away. You have the whole alphabet to guess through and once you guess that letter it is canceled out for the duration of the round. You're also on a timer every round of letter guessing to sweat your armpits trying to guess the letters of the word. If you get the word right, you are rewarded with street credits and a pat on the back. The challenger in this game has the choice of continuing or stopping the game right there. There's only so many rounds of words, but once you get to the end you will feel like a space-man/woman.

## Review on self

What have I learned throughout this game?
    I have learned a lot about myself through this game. When it comes to coding a whole project, you really have to take your time with each piece instead of rushing into each function. I've learned from a lot of my peers on organizing and making sure that I'm just working on one piece and not all of them all-together. Making sure that I'm tackling one small goal at a time.

What are the struggles that I encountered when I was making this game?
    I struggled with getting my buttons to show on the screen and to whether or not hard-code it within the HTML or give it a const within the javascript. This was definitely something I was confuse about for an hour. I also struggled with creating each button to function that I wanted too. 

What was I most happy about when creating this game?
    Getting my visuals to connect to the wrong guesses.
